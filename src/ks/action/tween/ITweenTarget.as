	/**
	 * A <em>tween target</em> is a bundle that wraps up a property or other value that can be 
	 * tweened by a KSTween object.
	 * In most cases, this will be a property of an object (see TargetProperty class) but it 
	 * could also be something more complex like a tween target that sets the scaleX and scaleY
	 * of a sprite simultaneously or a property of a filter (which can't be set directly). 
	 * 
	 * Tween targets are useful because they allow the value-setting portion of a tween to be
	 * abstracted away and seperated from the timing and easing. This allows a variety of differnt
	 * types of values, such as filter properties, colors, and sound panning, to be set without 
	 * subclassing KSTween for every instance. It also allows for a single KSTween object to 
	 * control multiple tween targets.  
	 * 
	 * The tween target bundle will have a start and end value as well as providing an accessor
	 * to the current value of the target (via INumericController). 
	 * 
	 * Generally speaking, a KSTween will handle anything related to the timing of the tween
	 * while the ITweenTarget handles anything related to the values of the tween. For example,
	 * KSTween holds the duration of the tween and the controls for starting, stopping and pausing
	 * while the tween target has the start and end values and holds a reference to the object
	 * to be tweened.
