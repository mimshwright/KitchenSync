===== v0.3 =====
Created SVN repository at http://svn.mimswright.com/kitchensync/
renamed project to KitchenSync. Moved code to src folder
Added asdoc pages in the /bin/docs folder.
renamed com.mimswright.animation to com.mimswright.sync
optimized the way that actions listen to synchronizer
ensured the reusability of action classes
added autoDelete flag which deletes actions on complete if true
Tested and tweaked the SynchronizedSound class
Added addTrigger() and addEventTrigger() to AbstractSyncrhonizedAction so that actions can be triggered by other actions or by events
Added clone() method to most SynchronizedAction classes
Added cloneWithTarget() method to Tween class
Added reverse() and cloneReversed() methods to the Tween class
added reverseChildOrder() to ActionGroup
removed shortcuts for amplitude, period, and overshoot
Added snapToValueOnComplete and snapToWholeNumber to Tween class
Added documentation to easing functions
Moved Sine.oscillate() to Oscillate.sine()
Added absoluteSine(), sawtooth(), and pulse() to the Oscillate class
Added Sextic easing class
Added Stepped easing class which produces an easing function that is stepped based on another one.
Added getAveragedFunction() to EasingUtils which produces an average of two types of easing funcitons.
Removed easeIn(), easeOut(), easeInOut() for Linear and Random
Added Tween.EXISTING_FROM_VALUE as the from value default. Reordered Tween constructor parameters.

===== v0.2 =====
Staggered groups
SyncrhonizedSound (not tested)
Wait class
Renamed SynchronizedEvent to SynchronizedDispatchEvent
rewrote all penner v2 easing functions to use fewer arguments and ported to as3
Sine.oscillate() and Random.ease() easing functions
EasingUtil added with call() method for more safely calling easing functions and the generateArray() method for precalculating
ability to set easing function modifiers on a Tween object (includes shortcuts for amplitude, period, and overshoot)
Fixed a bug with Parallel where items were deleted from array on complete.
ITweenable and TargetProperty classes (aren't implemented yet)
